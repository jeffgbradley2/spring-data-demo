# spring-data-demo

This is a simple project I used to review some things as I go through a spring data jpa course. It consists of a simple domain model for a Customer with Products, with a REST API, services, and repositories. 

Some things that were on the more advanced side which I reviewed are:

1. JPA Specification (see the ProductSpecification class)
2. Mapstruct Decorators

Everything else is pretty simple CRUD operations for now, but I will add additional features as they come up in the course.
